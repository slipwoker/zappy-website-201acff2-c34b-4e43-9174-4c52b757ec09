  "story_p_11": "In the heart of Jerusalem, between the alleyways of the Old City and the new neighborhoods, a simple dream was born: to bring the authentic flavors of home-style bakery to all lovers of true taste. Every morning we bake with our own hands, with love and tradition, pastries that remind us of home, of the warmth and special Jerusalem hospitality.",
  "story_p_12": "Our recipes are passed down from generation to generation, combined with modern baking techniques and quality ingredients carefully selected. Each pastry contains a story, each aroma evokes a memory, and each bite connects us to our roots.",
  "story_p_13": "We believe that a good bakery is not just food – it's an experience, it's quality time, it's a moment of simple joy in the heart of the city.",
  "story_p_14": "Every pastry begins with careful selection of raw materials. Flour from local mills, fresh butter, and flavor ingredients carefully chosen. We believe that when you start with quality ingredients, the taste speaks for itself—without unnecessary additives, without shortcuts.",
  "story_p_15": "Our bakery works with suppliers from the region, some of them families who have known the craft for generations. It's not just a matter of taste—it's also a commitment to the community and to the source of everything we bake here.",
  "story_p_16": "Every dough needs its time. Slow fermentation process, hand kneading, and attention to temperatures—that's what turns a good pastry into an excellent pastry. We don't rush, because we know that true taste comes only when you let the process develop naturally.",
  "story_p_17": "Our pastries are baked in precisely calibrated ovens, with close supervision at every stage. It's a craft that requires dedication—and it shows in every bite.",
  "story_p_18": "Jerusalem is not just a backdrop—it's part of the bakery's identity. The flavors we incorporate reflect the meeting between traditions: za'atar from the market, spices that remind us of the old neighborhoods, and combinations born from the city's cultural diversity.",
  "story_p_19": "Each pastry carries something of the unique character of this place—from the Jerusalem stone to the aromas that mix in the streets. It's an experience that begins with taste and ends with a feeling of belonging.",
  "story_p_20": "Every corner of our bakery tells a story of tradition and love. From the moment you enter, the aroma of fresh pastries and warm atmosphere invite you to stay, enjoy and feel at home.
